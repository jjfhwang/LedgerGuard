# LedgerGuard

**Description**

LedgerGuard is a Typescript library designed to provide robust transaction validation and security for blockchain applications. It offers a suite of tools to help developers ensure the integrity and authenticity of transactions before they are submitted to the blockchain, mitigating potential risks such as double-spending, unauthorized access, and data corruption. LedgerGuard acts as a crucial layer of defense, helping to safeguard the security and reliability of your decentralized applications.

**Features**

*   **Transaction Signature Verification:** Verifies the cryptographic signatures of transactions to ensure they are authorized by the correct parties. This prevents unauthorized modification or forgery of transactions.
*   **Input/Output Validation:** Validates the inputs and outputs of transactions, checking for inconsistencies, invalid amounts, and unauthorized spending. This helps prevent double-spending and other fraudulent activities.
*   **Customizable Validation Rules:** Allows developers to define custom validation rules tailored to their specific application requirements. This provides flexibility and adaptability to different blockchain implementations and use cases.
*   **Replay Attack Protection:** Implements mechanisms to prevent replay attacks, where previously valid transactions are re-submitted to the blockchain. This ensures that transactions are only executed once.
*   **Data Integrity Checks:** Performs checksums and other data integrity checks to ensure that the transaction data has not been tampered with during transmission or storage. This protects against data corruption and manipulation.

**Installation**

To install LedgerGuard, you will need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. Once you have these prerequisites, you can install LedgerGuard using the following command:
